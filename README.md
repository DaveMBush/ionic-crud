This is an ionic crud demo just to show that I can do it.

You can view the resulting application at https://davembush.github.io/ionic-crud/

The app will always start fresh with 2 records.

You can:
1) Delete a record by swiping to the left
2) Add a new record by clicking the + button, fill in the form, save
3) Edit an existing record by "clicking" a row, change, save.
4) To return to the list screen from the edit screen, click the back arrow

Best viewed on a phone.
